        "QuickSort is a sorting algorithm based on the Divide and Conquer algorithm that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array. The key process in QuickSort is partitioning. The target of partitioning is to place the pivot (any element can be chosen to be a pivot) at its correct position in the sorted array and put all smaller elements to the left of the pivot, and all greater elements to the right of the pivot. This partition is done recursively which finally sorts the array.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s an example of how QuickSort works: Consider an array: {10, 80, 30, 90, 40, 50, 70}\n",
        "\n",
        "First Pass: The whole array is traversed sequentially to find the smallest value. In this case, 11 is the lowest value. So 64 is replaced with 11. After one iteration, 11 appears in the first position of the sorted list.\n",
        "Second Pass: The rest of the array is traversed again to find the second lowest value. In this case, it’s 12. So 25 is swapped with 12.\n",
        "Third Pass: The rest of the array is traversed again to find the third lowest value. In this case, it’s 22. So 25 is swapped with 22.\n",
        "Fourth Pass: The rest of the array is traversed again to find the fourth lowest value. In this case, it’s 25. So it stays in its place.\n",
        "Fifth Pass: The largest value present in the array automatically gets placed at the last position in the array. The resulted array is now sorted."

The function returns the index of the pivot element after partitioning. The quick_select function takes a list of integers lst, two indices left and right, and an integer k as inputs and returns the k-th smallest element in the sublist lst[left:right+1]. The function uses the QuickSelect algorithm to find the k-th smallest element by recursively partitioning the sublist around a pivot element until the pivot element is at index k. The kth_smallest function takes a list of integers lst and an integer k as inputs and returns the k-th smallest element in the list. The function calls the quick_select function with the appropriate arguments to find the k-th smallest element.\n",

        "\n",
        "Selection Sort: Selection sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the first element of the unsorted part. The time complexity of selection sort can be calculated as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "In the first pass, the algorithm compares the first element with all  $n-1 $ remaining elements to find the minimum element.\n",
        "In the second pass, the algorithm compares the second element with all $ n-2$ remaining elements to find the minimum element.\n",
        "This continues until the last pass, where the algorithm compares the second-last element with the last remaining element to find the minimum element.\n",
        "The total number of comparisons can be calculated as $(n-1) + (n-2) + … + 1 = n(n-1)/2$. Since this is a quadratic expression, we can say that selection sort has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in the worst case.\n",
        "\n",
        "Insertion Sort: Insertion sort works by repeatedly taking an element from the unsorted part of the array and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted part of the array. The time complexity of insertion sort can be calculated as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "In the worst case, each element needs to be compared with all the elements in the sorted part of the array before being inserted into its correct position.\n",
        "This means that in the first pass, there is 1 comparison; in the second pass, there are 2 comparisons; in the third pass, there are 3 comparisons; and so on.\n",
        "The total number of comparisons can be calculated as $1 + 2 + … + (n-1) = n(n-1)/2$. Since this is a quadratic expression, we can say that insertion sort has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in the worst case.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quicksort: Quicksort works by partitioning the array into two smaller sub-arrays and then recursively sorting those sub-arrays. The time complexity of quicksort can be calculated as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "In the best case, each partition divides the array into two equal-sized sub-arrays. This means that each recursive call processes a sub-array half the size of its parent.\n",
        "This results in a recursion tree where each level has half as many nodes as its parent and where each node does $O(n)$ work to partition its sub-array.\n",
        "Since there are $log(n)$ levels in this tree and each level does $O(n)$ work, we can say that quicksort has a time complexity of $O(n log(n))$ in the best case.\n",
        "In contrast, in the worst case, each partition divides the array into two sub-arrays where one is empty and one has size $n-1$. This results in a recursion tree where each level has only one node and where each node does $O(n)$ work to partition its sub-array. Since there are $n$ levels in this tree and each level does $O(n)$ work, we can say that quicksort has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in the worst case.\n",
